# PowerShell Job Saving Status

## ‚ùå Current Issue: Database Connectivity

**PowerShell jobs are NOT saving because the database connection is failing.**

### Error Message:
```
[JOB_MANAGER] CRITICAL: System database connection failed - PowerShell jobs cannot be saved
[JOB_MANAGER] Check database configuration in config/database_config.yaml
[JOB_MANAGER] Ensure SQL Server is accessible and pyodbc is installed
```

### Root Cause:
1. **SQL Server not accessible** - `USDF11DB197\PROD_DB01:3433` cannot be reached from macOS
2. **pyodbc not working** - Missing ODBC drivers for SQL Server on macOS
3. **Development vs Production environment** - This is a macOS dev environment, not Windows production

### What Works:
- ‚úÖ PowerShell job creation logic
- ‚úÖ Job validation and configuration
- ‚úÖ Script content handling
- ‚úÖ Web interface for job creation

### What Doesn't Work:
- ‚ùå Database connectivity (pyodbc on macOS)
- ‚ùå SQL Server connection to production server
- ‚ùå Job persistence to database

## üîß Solution

**Deploy to Windows environment with SQL Server access:**

1. **Windows Server/Machine** with:
   - SQL Server ODBC Driver 17 installed
   - Network access to `USDF11DB197\PROD_DB01:3433`
   - Python with pyodbc working

2. **Test connectivity**:
   ```bash
   python test_connection_system.py
   ```

3. **Expected result**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Database connection successful
   ‚úÖ PowerShell jobs will save to SQL Server
   ```

## üìã Current Status Summary

- **PowerShell job logic**: ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Database connectivity**: ‚ùå FAILED (environment issue)
- **Job saving**: ‚ùå BLOCKED by database issue
- **Ready for production**: ‚úÖ YES (on Windows with SQL Server access)

The code is correct. The environment is the limitation.
